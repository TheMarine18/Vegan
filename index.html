            <h2>Eating healthy in modern age and time</h2>
            <p>If you were wondering about how to start eating healthy and feel good, you've come to the right place. On this
                website I am going to share my experience and knowledge about what to include in your diet and how to start
                choosing the right products and recipies for yourself. Let's begin.
            </p>
            <p>Your diet should largely depend on your location. I've been to Thailand and there it is really easy to maintaint 
                fruit diet by eating relatively cheap local produce, such as mango, coconuts and bananas. Lots of sun and good 
                weather, water nearby really makes this place seem like a paradise.
                Right now I am in more northern climate and here instead of mango I eat lots of apples, carrots and occasionally
                avocados from a local supermarket. As for my diet, I don't eat any meat or dairy, but do eat lots of fruit, vegetables
                and pasta, grain products. I'll list some of my favourites here and the corresponding recipies/combinations.
